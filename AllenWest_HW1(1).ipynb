The empty space will get where it needs to be because if it is not where it needs to be, then at least one other piece will also be out of place. In the second scenario, it is inadmissible because you are overestimating the cost it takes to reach the goal. Take, for example, a simple one-move left example. If the 15 and blank tiles need to be switched, the heuristic would show that there are 2 out of place tiles as opposed to the one. "

Similarly, euclidian also represents the amount of work better than number of tiles misplaced, but due to the restraints of the game, misrepresents the work based on the moves allowed.

A newer heuristic could consider blocks of ordered tiles in the right row and instead of counting them separately, produce values of work based on what would happen if they moved as a singular unit. We would know that this would always be the right choice because the blocks have to stay next to each other in these cases. This would only work if they were in the right row already. The values returned could be 0, 1, 2, for moving left to right, and then tiles moving up and down or tiles not currently ordered in their row could be asessed the typical manhattan way. This would be admissible because instead of counting 3 for the block of [- 13 14 15], it would count 1, which is accurate according to the new rules."
